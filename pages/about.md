# **History**

The project FVUS (Finite Volume Utilities and Solvers)  was started on 1st January 2015 with the aim of providing a very robust and highly adaptable multi-physics solver. 

 With accuracy being of the utmost importance following goals were set: 
- Highly parallel, multi-region and multi-phase solver
- Shall be extremely stable and should provide reliable results even with worse of meshes.
- Easy to accommodate new research ideas
- Easy to be used in research by means of user-coding that provides user high level of control
- Easy to be developed by a team of developers
- Easy to install and use (example: single command set up of case and running the iterations)
